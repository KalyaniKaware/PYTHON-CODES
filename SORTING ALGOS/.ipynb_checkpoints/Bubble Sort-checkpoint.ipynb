    "This simple sorting algorithm iterates over a list, comparing elements in pairs and swapping them until the larger elements \"bubble up\" to the end of the list, and the smaller elements stay at the \"bottom\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "We begin by comparing the first two elements of the list. If the first element is larger than the second element, we swap them. If they are already in order we leave them as is. We then move to the next pair of elements, compare their values and swap as necessary. This process continues to the last pair of items in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon reaching the end of the list, it repeats this process for every item. Though, this is highly inefficient. What if only a single swap needs to be made in the array? Why would we still iterate though it n^2 times, even though it's already sorted?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, to optimize the algorithm, we need to stop it when it's finished sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would we know that we are finished sorting? If the items were in order then we would not have to swap items. So, whenever we swap values we set a flag to True to repeat sorting process. If no swaps occurred, the flag would remain False and the algorithm would stop."

Therefore, if we have n elements in our list, we would have n iterations per item - thus Bubble Sort's time complexity is O(n^2)."
