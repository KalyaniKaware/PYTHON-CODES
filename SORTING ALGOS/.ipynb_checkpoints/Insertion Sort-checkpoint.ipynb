    "**Explanation**\n",
    "We assume that the first element of the list is sorted. We then go to the next element, let's call it x. If x is larger than the first element we leave as is. If x is smaller, we copy the value of the first element to the second position and then set the first element to x.\n",

    "As we go to the other elements of the unsorted segment, we continuously move larger elements in the sorted segment up the list until we encounter an element smaller than x or reach the end of the sorted segment, and then place x in it's correct position."
